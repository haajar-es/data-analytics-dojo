# Data Analytics Dojo ðŸ§ ðŸ“Š

**Welcome to the Data Analytics Dojo!** This repository is dedicated to continuous learning and growth in the world of data analytics. This dojo serves as a collection of assignments, projects, tutorials, and case studies covering a broad range of topics and tools.

## Overview
This repository is a personal journey of learning and exploring various data analytics topics, from exploratory data analysis (EDA) and data visualization to advanced topics like outlier detection and building data pipelines. It includes practical applications of popular tools and languages such as:

* SQL
* Power BI
* Excel
* Python
* Jupyter Notebooks
  
The goal of this dojo is to provide a structured and collaborative environment for developing and sharpening data analytics skills over time. As I continue learning, more advanced content will be added, covering various aspects of data engineering, machine learning, business intelligence, and more.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders, each representing a different project or area of study:
